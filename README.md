Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?
- Your wisdom? :)

I used this exercise as a gauge of where my skills are at now. I gave myself a maximum time of 45 minutes to complete this exercise and actually did it within 30 minutes! Everything was simple to do and I didn't have to look up anything in any extra resources for once!

### Built With

Purely HTML and CSS.
